A simple User Management Application built with React.js that allows users to:

Login & Authentication – Users can log in, and their authentication token is stored securely in localStorage.

User Listing – Fetches and displays a paginated list of users from an API.

Edit & Update Users – Modify user details dynamically and update them via API calls.

Delete Users – Remove users from the list with a delete function.

Pagination Support – Navigate between different pages of users.

This project utilizes React Hooks, Fetch API, and CSS Modules for a clean and modern UI.
